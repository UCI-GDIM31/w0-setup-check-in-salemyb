# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.
My name is Salem Bacalski, my pronouns are they/she, I'm a Filipino-Mexican from San Diego and this is my first year at UCI. I love video games, mostly soulslikes, roguelikes, and Zelda games and my favorite game is Majora's Mask. I'm taking this class for my major but I am extremely interested in game design (obviously). I have pretty much no prior experience with game development, only really doing the first few parts of the Unity tutorial about a year ago and I think I've completely forgotten most of what I learned. I think a game that I would hope to build would be something fast paced that can just feel good to play and get into a flow like Hades or Sekiro.

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [X] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [ ] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [ ] Undecided
    - [ ] Other (please specify)

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?
I hope to be able to get a basic understanding of programming to give me a start in learning the code parts of game development.

4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?
I think I'm most nervous for navigating and memorizing how to use GitHub and Unity and I'm afraid I am going to mess something up just in learning navigating these tools. (I already am nervous if I'm doing this assignment right)

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. Programming (any languages/ frameworks)
Started the Unity C# tutorial around a year ago, probably don't remember much if anything.
2. Game development (any engine)
Same as above
3. Unity
Same as above
### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

1. Game design document
N/A
2. Scope management
N/A
3. Iteration
N/A
4. Object-Oriented programming
N/A
5. Model-View-Controller architecture
N/A
